## **WIKI**<br>

Download the .zip file, extract the files, copy the file `.conkyrc_wacurrent` and the folder `.conky` inside your Linux `home`.<br>
If your `home` is named *pippo*, copy inside *pippo* so you get: `/home/pippo/.conky` and `/home/pippo/.conkyrc_wacurrent`<br>
Go to `/home/YOURHOMENAME/.conky/weather/Weatherapi/today/` and open with a text editor the file `todaywadata.py`, go to row 20 and 21 and type your latitude and your longitude, go to row 22 and write your city, go to row 23 and type your app id, go to row 29 and type your north degree.<br>
If you don't know how to get your APPID, follow this video instructions: [APPID guide](https://youtu.be/FgRy3O12DKo?si=rF_3Zoh0NZox_qXP&t=103)<br>
If you don't know how to get your north degree, follow this video instructions: [North degree guide](https://youtu.be/FxcR7c3YwEQ?si=e-9_AJ79xs_eF-0Z&t=220)<br>
<br>
In the `font` folder, you can find some fonts you need.<br>
The python script saves data in files so you can build your conky weather as you wish.<br>
The `.conkyrc_wacurrent` file i attach, works.<br>
Run the file `.conkyrc_wacurrent` from terminal (the first time you run this conky), so you can get possible errors.
